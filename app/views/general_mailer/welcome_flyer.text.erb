We've extended the Read-A-Thon for one extra day just for you!  It's not too late to support the Read For Richmond Read-A-Thon with your pledge.

<%= @student.first %> has been reading every day in class - log on today to see their progress http://www.read4richmond.com/autologin/<%= @student.code %>.

If your child has been reading at home, you can estimate their reading time and add it all in today!

You can also make a direct contribution to the Richmond Foundation https://allhandsraised.org/donate/.  Remember, the Read-A-Thon supports the Foundation's mission: funding staff positions at Richmond.  Whether you contribute through the Read-A-Thon, make a direct gift online, or drop a check in the big blue mailbox, you are supporting Richmond's dual-immersion model and the enrichments and activities that mean so much to our kids.

Together we can do it!  Issho ni ganbarou!
